A simple electronic academic transcript written in C and Gtk.

Notes
======

This program is based on italian university system, so marks range from 18 to 30 and the graduation mark is up to 110. Furthermore, graduation mark is simply calcualated in proportion to the average mark, so it should be only taken as a clue. Other factors weight on the calculation of the graduation mark and since these often depend on different departments or universities these aren't taken into account in the program.

Installation
======

Pretty classic:

* cd src
* make
* make install (be root)

To uninstall:

* make uninstall (be root)
